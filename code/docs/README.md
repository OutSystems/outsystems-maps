# OutSystems Maps arquitecture diagram
This folder contains the UML diagram of the OutSystems Maps typescript code, in the different formats.

## How to use the diagrams?
The arquitecture desgined using UML (Unified Modeling Language) format.
For a quick reference use file [OutSystems-maps-UML.svg](https://github.com/OutSystems/outsystems-maps/blob/dev/documentation/OutSystems-maps-UML.svg) to see how to navigate through the concepts and code.

## When should the UML change?
The diagram is a living blueprint of the OutSystems Maps typescript code, and will always reflect the current architecture of the code.
If you are doing a PR request that introduces changes in the code on architecture level (adding methods, parameters, classes, etc...), please reflect these changes also in the UML.

### How to change the UML?
The file [OutSystems-maps-UML.mdj](https://github.com/OutSystems/outsystems-maps/blob/dev/documentation/OutSystems-maps-UML.mdj), is the source file for the diagram. To change please download a compatible tool for changing it.

### What tool are we using to modelate the UML?
We are using [starUML](https://staruml.io/) as the prefered tool to modelate the UML.
